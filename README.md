So the whole idea originally is to make an Uber-like app in Cordova purely for hobby. The source is for client's and driver's app (depends on which user logged in).
It's very simple. The client makes and order, every driver will be notified of it and the bidding starts. Once a driver takes the order, the client will be notified. There's a map to show both client's and driver's location but it's not a real time position tracker like Uber yet. After the driver takes the client to the destination, the client will give feedback and score his/her trip.
